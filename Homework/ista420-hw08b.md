Homework questions
1. The sales tax rate for a state just changed. How would you update the state sales tax table to reflect
the changes? Assume that this table has an ID column, an RATE column, and a STATE column.
update salestaxtable set rate = 0.05332 where state id like 'GA';

2. The Revenue Division has requested that you provide a report on what the actual sales taxes would
have been for all orders in the past year, assuming the retroactivity of the new sales tax rate. How
would you calculate this?
select  salesamount, salesid,
 3.5 as newrate,(salesamount * newrate) as newtax,
 sum (salesamount * newrate) as newtotaltax 
 from salesforlastyear
  where year = 2017
  group by salesid;
